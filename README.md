# ☀️ Felicity Solar for Home Assistant (Smilebob Edition)

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/smilebob/felicity_solar_hacs)

A custom integration for Home Assistant to monitor your Felicity Solar setup (including Felicity T-REX and Hybrid Inverters). This integration securely connects to the Shine Felicity Solar API to fetch real-time data for your High Frequency / Low Frequency / Hybrid / T-REX Inverters and Lithium Battery Packs, automatically creating native Home Assistant sensors and supporting the built-in Energy Dashboard.


> **Note:** This integration was _VibeTranslated_ to Python directly from my original NodeJS FelicityAPI implementation! ⚡️

## ✨ Features

- **UI Configuration:** Easy setup via the Home Assistant UI (no YAML required).
- **Auto-Discovery:** Automatically detects all registered Inverters and Batteries tied to your account.
- **Inverter Sensors:** AC Input/Output, PV Voltage/Power, Load Percentage, Temperatures, and more.
- **Battery Sensors:** State of Charge (SOC), State of Health (SOH), Voltage, Current, and Rated Energy.
- **Energy Dashboard Ready:** Includes `total_increasing` energy sensors (Energy PV Today, Load Today, Total Energy) ready to be plugged directly into the HA Energy Dashboard.
